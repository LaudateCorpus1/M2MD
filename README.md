## Installation
 
### Manual
 
   Go to 'releases' tab and download appropriate .paclet file.
    
   Run `PacletInstall @ path/to/the.paclet` file
   
### Via ``MPM` ``
   
If you don't have ``MPM` `` yet, run:
   
    Import["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubapod/mpm/master/install.m"]
   
and then:
   
    Needs @ "MPM`"
